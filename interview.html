<h1>Ques4:Difference between absolute and relative positioning</h1>
<h3>
    position: relative
The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.

It still takes up space in the layout (others don't shift).

You can use top, right, bottom, and left to move it slightly from where it would normally be.

<pre>
.relative-box {
position: relative;
top: 10px;
left: 20px;
}</pre>
<h3>
    position: absolute
The element is removed from the normal document flow (other elements behave as if it doesn’t exist).

It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).

If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the <html> (the document body).
<pre>
.absolute-box {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
right: 0;
}
</pre>

    <h1>Ques6:What is the difference between padding and margin?</h1>
    <h3>
        Padding: Space inside an element, between its content and border. It affects the element’s size 
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Margin: Space outside an element, between its border and other elements. It does not affect the element’s size.
